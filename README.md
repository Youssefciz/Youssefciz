🌍 Originally from Egypt, I spent my childhood in Kuwait where my father pursued his engineering career. In 2019, I embarked on a new journey to the United States to pursue higher education.

📚 My fascination with computers began at an early age and only intensified during my high school years. Taking my first programming and computer science classes ignited a passion within me that continues to drive my career aspirations today.

🎓 Currently pursuing my degree in Computer Science, I am eagerly preparing myself to transition into the professional world. I am excited about the prospect of applying my skills and knowledge to real-world projects that make a difference.
